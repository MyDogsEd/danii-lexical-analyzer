# sol-lexical-analyzer
A Discord bot to perform lexical analysis on sol's keyboard-smashes

## Running
In the main directory of the project, create the `execution`
folder. Inside it, create a single file called `BOT_KEY.apikey`,
and paste your API key onto the first line with no extra whitespace
before or after. Next, run the `buildAndRunJar` gradle task, and this
will run the bot!

## Version
USE JAVA 17 PLEASE!!! I am too lazy to update the VM's Java version, so 
we're sticking with compiling with Java 17.0.13.
