# danii-lexical-analyzer
A Discord bot to perform lexical analysis on danii's keyboard-smashes

## Running
***
In the main directory of the project, create the `execution`
folder. Inside it, create a single file called `BOT_KEY.apikey`,
and paste your API key onto the first line with no extra whitespace
before or after. Next, run the `buildAndRunJar` gradle task, and this
will run the bot!
